This repository demonstrates a subtle but dangerous bug in Rust related to raw pointers and vector ownership. The `bug.rs` file contains the buggy code, which modifies a vector using a raw pointer after the vector's ownership has changed.  The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version that avoids undefined behavior.  This example highlights the importance of careful memory management and understanding Rust's ownership system.
